# Medical Image Classification using Deep Learning
2nd year summer (2017-18) project under Dr. Nishchal K. Verma. The aim of the project was to perform binary and multi-class image classification using layer-wise training, data augmentation and transfer learning. We used publicly available chest x-ray and retinal oct image datasets for this purpose. The codes are written in Python-3 using Keras framework.
